    {
        Scanner s=new Scanner(System.in);
      char c=s.next().charAt(0);
      int a=(int)c;
      System.out.println(a);
    }
}

Q3.During the Physical Education hour, PT sir has decided to conduct some team games. He wants to split the students in the class into equal-sized teams. 
In some cases, there may be some students who are left out from teams and he wanted to use the left out, students, to assist him in conducting the team 
games. For instance, if there are 50 students in the class and if the class has to be divided into 7 equal-sized teams, 7 students will be there in each 
team and 1 student will be left out. PT sir asks your help to automate this team splitting task. Can you please help him out?

Q4.Ajay, Binoy, and Chandru were very close friends at school. They were very good in Mathematics and they were the pet students of Emily Mam. Their 
gang was known as 3-idiots. Ajay, Binoy, and Chandru live in the same locality. A new student Dinesh joins their class and he wanted to be friends 
with them. He asked Binoy about his house address. Binoy wanted to test Dinesh's mathematical skills. Binoy told Dinesh that his house is at the 
midpoint of the line joining Ajay's house and Chandru's house. Dinesh was puzzled. Can you help Dinesh out? Given the coordinates of the 2 endpoints
